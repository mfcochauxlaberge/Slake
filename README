Slake (Snake + Slick) is a small snake game written in Java. It uses the Slick library.

Catch the purple dot to grow and make a point. Yellow dots give ten points instead of one. The black "X" makes you smaller and blue dots make you a ghost so you don't die when ou hit your own body.

The game is finished. It should not get major updates. It is here as an example of a game written in Java using the Slick library.
